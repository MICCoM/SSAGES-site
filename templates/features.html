                Within the elastic band method, the top level construct, a
                string defining a path between two sites in free energy space,
                is decomposed into a set of individual nodes which perform
                short umbrella sampling calculations using a set of parallel
                molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo calculations. At the end of
                a data-gathering run, the position of the node in free-energy
                space is updated, and through communication with neighboring
                elements, the path is redefined. The figure at right presents a
                simple validation of the metadynamics and elastic band method
                codes in SAGES suite. The heat-map is generated using
                metadynamics performed on a single particle within a two
                dimensional field containing three Gaussian potentials, one
                peak and two wells. The minimum free-energy pathway between the
                wells is obtained through evolution of a string with 96 nodes.
                The system in this case evolves until only minimal driving
                forces from the underlying FES remain; extended simulation
                would push the elastic band out to hug the bounding
                surface.</h4>

                General-geometry Ewald-like Method</h2>

                <hr>


                <h4>The scheme provided by the General geometry Ewald-like
                Method (GgEM) is a platform for multi-scale problems in physics
                and chemistry. Applied to hydrodynamic equations, the method
                solves for the proper behavior (both Brownian and Hydrodynamic)
                of discrete entities such as polymers, cells and colloids, in
                continuous fluid media. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved
                using a Green's function approach for long-range interactions.
                At right is a demonstration of GGEM methods applied to the
                resolution of flow fields in suspensions of self-motile
                particles.</h4>

                Fast Multipole Boundary-element Method</h2>

                <hr>


                <h4>The Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (FMBEM) is a
                code framework for various integral problems encountered in
                scientific and engineering communities. It runs in parallel and
                utilizes iterative solver GMRES accelerated by a
                kernel-independent Fast Multipole Method (FMM) with O(N)
                computational complexity. It applies to electrostatic
                polarization problem involving arbitrary-shaped polarizable
                dielectric objects embeded in a dielectric continuum, and also
                to the calculation of interactions between
                ferromagnetic/ferroelectric objects with arbitrary shapes. The
                code is being developed using libMesh (finite-element library)
                and ScalFMM (FMM library). At right is a demonstration of the
                FMBEM applied to the electrostatic polarization problem among
                interacting polarizable particles.</h4>

                <hr>


                <h4>The <strong>continuum--particle coupling</strong> provided
                by COPSS enables the spanning of multiple timescales in
                simulation. The initial suite of routines is built around the
                General-geometry Ewald-like Method (GgEM) which enables
                simulations such as that shown below, where a discrete polymer
                chain, modeling DNA, is embedded in a background solvent, and
                confined to a nanoscopic channel; <strong>without coupling
                algorithms such as GgEM, such simulations are
                impossible.</strong></h4>
