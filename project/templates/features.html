                Within the elastic band method, the top level construct, a
                string defining a path between two sites in free energy space,
                is decomposed into a set of individual nodes which perform
                short umbrella sampling calculations using a set of parallel
                molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo calculations. At the end of
                a data-gathering run, the position of the node in free-energy
                space is updated, and through communication with neighboring
                elements, the path is redefined. The figure at right presents a
                simple validation of the metadynamics and elastic band method
                codes in SAGES suite. The heat-map is generated using
                metadynamics performed on a single particle within a two
                dimensional field containing three Gaussian potentials, one
                peak and two wells. The minimum free-energy pathway between the
                wells is obtained through evolution of a string with 96 nodes.
                The system in this case evolves until only minimal driving
                forces from the underlying FES remain; extended simulation
                would push the elastic band out to hug the bounding
                surface.</h4></div>

                dielectric objects embedded in a dielectric continuum, and also
                to the calculation of interactions between
                ferromagnetic/ferroelectric objects with arbitrary shapes. The

				Parallel finite element general geometry Ewald-like method (pFE-GgEm) is an efficient O(N) and 
                fully scalable computation framework to model the dynamics of Brownian particles considering 
                long-range hydrodynamic interactions (HI) in any geometries. The framework combines a FEM Stokesâ€™ 
                solver with GgEm, a mid-point integration scheme, and a Chebyshev polynomial approximation based 
                on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It is built on open-source scientific packages, such as 
                LIBMESH (framework of solving PDEs), PETSC (parallel linear, non-linear equation solver) and SLEPC (eigenvalue calculations).
