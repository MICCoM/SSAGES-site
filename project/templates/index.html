                <hr>


                <div class="large-8 columns"><h4>The <strong>continuum--particle coupling</strong> provided
                by COPSS enables the spanning of multiple timescales in
                simulation. The initial suite of routines is built around the
                General-geometry Ewald-like Method (GgEM) which enables
                simulations such as that shown below, where a discrete polymer
                chain, representing DNA, is embedded in a background solvent, and
                confined to a nanoscopic channel; <strong>without coupling
                algorithms such as GgEM, such simulations are
                impossible.</strong>
                <br><br>
                The continuum--particle coupling of COPSS permits efficient 
                simulation of many-body systems such as the DNA nanoslit (see video) on the timescales of 
                polymer diffusion. In the first video, 84 kilobase DNA is simulated under confinement in a nanochannel with full 
                hydrodynamic coupling to itself and the system boundaries.
                <br><br>
                COPSS also permits the simulation of electrostatic interactions with polarization effects in heterogeneous 
                dielectric media in an accurate, highly efficient manner. In the second video, 10 polarizable micron-sized particles are 
                simulated in an vacuum environment where only long-range electrostatic interaction and short-range excluded 
                volume interaction affect their motion. The electrostatic forces are calculated by COPSS at each time step, 
                and the particles' positions are evolved by coupling COPSS with LAMMPS.

                DASH is a <strong>GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics</strong> software package designed for both <strong>atomistic and coarse grained simulations</strong>. 
                DASH is controlled via a <strong>powerful Python interface</strong>, which gives the user full control to set up, modify, and analyze 
                simulations all within one script. Using <strong>efficient parallel algorithms</strong>, DASH also provides the facility to compute arbitrarily 
                complex user-defined types of data while maintaining <strong>high performance</strong>.
                <br><br>
                DASH is <strong>specifically optimized for running with the the advanced sampling package SSAGES</strong>, 
                allowing up to <strong>double the performance of leading competitors</strong>. With plain molecular dynamics, performance in DASH is comparable 
                to the <strong>fastest codes available</strong>.
                <br><br>
                DASH supports <strong>several water models</strong> including TIP3P, TIP4P (and variants), as well as the E3B model, a fast and robust 3-body 
                water model parameterized to capture much of the water phase diagram (Kumar, JPC, 2008).
                <br><br>
                In addition to these features, DASH provides all the standard functionality users have come to expect from a batteries-included 
                molecules dynamics package, including a variety of <strong>thermostats, barostats, elegant methods for dealing with molecules, long range 
                charge computation, multiple force fields, and much more</strong>.
